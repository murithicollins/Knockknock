                The vision of knock knock is to build a single platform that convey all kinds of sounds to persons with hearing loss. We started by conveying a door knock and our journey is still in progress
                ALT Image description: This image shows the roadmap for knock knock. They started by building a solution to convey a door knock to the Deaf then proceeded to bell ringing sounds in schools for the Deaf, 
                which they call i-bel. They are currently working towards representing teh sound of baby crying for Deaf Mothers; which they call b. Monitor. Their next step is to look into outside sounds like car hooting. 
                Their eventual goal is to convey numerous sounds within a single gadget.
