        <h1 class="font-bold text-[#1D976C]">only 9% of the students know when the bell rings!</h1>
        <p class="text">
            A surprising fact we found when doing research in schools for the Deaf is that they use the
            ‘normal’ sound-based bell system.
            In a school with 135 students, where 123 are completely Deaf, 9 have partial hearing and 4
            have Cochlear implants, how can sound bell alerts be heard by the students?        </p>
