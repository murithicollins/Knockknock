    <p class="">
      Knock knock was started in December 2021 with the goal of building a gadget that could alert a Deaf person when a knock happened on their door. However, with research and study into the target population, we realized that the problem dug deeper than just the inability of Deaf persons to know when someone is at their door.
        Stories from the Deaf community revealed how crippled this population
        was by their inability to perceive sounds; which pushed us to think deeper, not just in terms of a product but what impact we, as experienced techies, could make on this community.
