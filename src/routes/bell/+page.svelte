                <p>The school bell system i impolrtant in creating  wel-organize structure for smooth running of activities in a school. It is used to announce critical times in the school, create routine, and to get attention 
                    in cases of emergencies. Most schools for the Deaf in Kenya use the ‘conventional’ 
                    sound based bell system which is ineffective because a majority of the students are Deaf. This implies the system is ineffective which could lead to - lack of respect for time, excuses for lateness, anda  decline in teaching quality.

                <p>
                    I-bell is a bell system that provides visual and sound alerts to capture attention of both hearing and Deaf students and staff within schools for the Deaf.

                    The system capializes on the existing Deaf culture of using flickering of lights as a way to call attention.
